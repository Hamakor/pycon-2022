## Czech Python User Group

At the end of 2015, two new websites about the Czech Python community emerged.
[Python.cz](http://python.cz/) is the main gateway for all sorts
of information, while at [pyvo.cz](http://pyvo.cz) it's all about our meetups.
You're always welcome to come and present at them!

## PyCon SK

Enjoyed attending our very first PyCon? How about visiting another one organized by our friends in Slovakia in March? Check
out [PyCon SK](https://pycon.sk/sk/) and their
[Django Girls event](http://djangogirls.org/bratislava/). They are still looking
for speakers, coaches, and of course, attendees.

## Thank you!

We hope you enjoyed the end of 2015. We're looking forward to new challenges that 2016 will bring us and we hope you stay with us, as awesome and as supporting as you have always been.
