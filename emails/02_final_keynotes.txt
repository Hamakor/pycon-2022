Keynote speakers confirmed

In the past two days we received valuable feedback from you and updated our website
accordingly. New information was added, other information was
clarified. Thank you all for your patience!

The most important news: Our second keynote speaker, Amber Brown, is confirmed.
She is the core developer and release manager of the Twisted project. As you
already know, the other keynote speaker is Russell Keith-Magee, core developer
of the Django web framework. We are very excited to have them both aboard!

The rest of the speakers will be announced at the beginning of October because
the Call for Papers is still open. Have you already submitted your talk?
If not, you can do it at the following link: http://cz.pycon.org/#speakers
