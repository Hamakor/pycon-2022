Hi {{ first_name }},

we've just added few more question to your ticket. None of them is required, but it help us with planning.

# Workshop registration

There will be 6 [workshops](https://cz.pycon.org/2015/workshops/) on Sunday in two blocks. One in the morning and one after lunch. Please pick one from the list so we know which room to assign to which workshop.

# Social events

A lot of pythonistas will be already in town on Friday. You can join organizers, speakers and DjangoGirls in [Molino Restaurant](http://www.molinorestaurant.cz) anytime after 7pm.

On Saturday we prepare a special event and after-party in a local pub. The location will be announced during the day, but it'll be definitely in city center.

# Thank you

That's it. If you want to, you can also tell us where are you from. As it's the first edition of PyCon CZ, we're super curious from which country people came from.

Looking forward to meet you in Brno!

Cheers,

Tom & PyCon CZ Team
