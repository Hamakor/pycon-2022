    "title": "Wrestling Python into LLVM Intermediate Representation",
    "abstract": "What is LLVM-IR? The LLVM Compiler Infrastructure Project provides a transportable intermediate representation (LLVM-IR) that can be compiled and linked into multiple types of assembly code. LLVM-IR is great because you can take any language and distill it into a form that can be run on many different machines. Once the code gets into IR it doesn’t matter what platform it was originally written on, and it doesn’t matter that Python can be slow. It doesn’t matter if you have weird CPUs - if they are supported by LLVM it will run. What is Tupleware? TupleWare is an analytical framework built at Brown University that allows users to compile functions into distributed programs that are automatically deployed. TupleWare is unique because it uses LLVM-IR to be language and platform independent. What is PyLLVM? This is the heart of the talk. PyLLVM is a simple, easy to extend, one-pass static compiler that takes in the subset of Python most likely to be used by Tupleware. PyLLVM is based on an existing project called py2llvm (https://code.google.com/archive/p/py2llvm) that was abandoned around 2011. This talk will go through some basic compiler design and talk about how some LLVM-IR features make our lives easier, and some much harder. It will cover types, scoping, memory management, and other implementation details. To conclude, it will compare PyLLVM to Numba, a Python-to-LLVM compiler from Continuum Analytics and touch on what the future has in store for PyLLVM. Talk Objective     Attendees will learn what LLVM-IR is and how it can be leveraged to allow data scientists to write their algorithms in Python. They will leave with a high-level understanding of the design process and considerations of writing a simple compiler. Last, they will know all about how PyLLVM coaxes Python code into LLVM-IR. It will become evident how cool LLVM and Python can be when they work together!",

    "abstract": "Those of us who build systems that deal with constant streams of incoming data (which includes anybody whose code touches the internet) often need algorithms that keep a fixed-size sample from the stream for on-the-fly analytics. Reservoir sampling is a commonly used algorithm for keeping a sample that's unbiased over all events in the stream. But what if you want your algorithm to keep a representative sample from the past 10 minutes instead of the entire stream? In this talk I'll start with a gentle introduction to Reservoir sampling for those who are not familiar with it, and then discuss several variants which keep a sample that is biased towards the present. One of these is the VIRB (Variable Incoming Rate Biased) sampler, which we have developed in-house at Magnetic. This talk covers the same material as this blog post: http://tech.magnetic.com/2016/04/virbs-sampling-events-from-streams.html",

Afterwards we will talk about how to make simple modifications to the bytecode in order to insert hook points into preexisting code. We will see how we can use pyrasite for inspecting and modifying an already running Python process (useful for debugging long-running servers or detecting memory leaks). Finally, we will survey some more generic Python bytecode modifiers and code injectors. Bonus points - How can CPython 2 (but not 3) can create valid yet unusable or wrong .pyc files from .py files? The talk will be based mainly on CPython 2.7. (1) bytehook https: //github.com/tzickel/bytehook (2) pyrasite https: //github.com/lmacken/pyrasite (3) codetransformer https: //github.com/llllllllll/codetransformer (4) PTVS code injector https: //github.com/Microsoft/PTVS/blob/0a3d9d17008e8d9b8fe2cb40c6c501f13861ccdb/Python/Product/PyDebugAttach/PyDebugAttach.cpp (5) that 20 years unclosed python 2 bug mentioned in the bonus points: ) https: //bugs.python.org/issue25083 + another timing quirk not documented.",

Even though Python doesn't require 'building' in the traditional way like C++, large code bases can benefit from Bazel's features. Bazel provides powerful tools for expressing and querying dependencies—even between systems in different languages. It also makes it possible to bundle applications with all of their dependencies into a hermetic package for distribution. This talk will cover 1) an introduction to Bazel and how it differs from other build systems, 2) how Bazel can be used with Python, and 3) the limitations of Bazel.",

How to run dozens of thousands of test cases on hundreds of machines in the cloud in parallel? Is it OK to have dependencies between test cases to make this task less expensive? Dva is an open source validation tool which is applicable to various images and instance types. Using your image, it will launch instances of different types in defined regions and will execute test cases in parallel. How? All test cases are represented as a Directed Acyclic Graph structure – parents and children. Then these test cases are assigned to workers by a modified BFS algorithm that allows processing of sibling test cases in parallel. It includes test result processing tools such as a Bugzilla module to report bugs for you. 3rd-party test case modules are supported too. This tool is used by Red Hat QE for RHEL image release sanity testing in EC2, however Fedora images and OpenStack cloud are supported too. To test a RHEL release, Dva launches hundreds of machines of various types in all EC2 regions and executes a set of nearly 70 test cases with dependencies on every machine in parallel.

In the cyber space, it's one of the biggest buzzwords of 2015 and most prominent tools used to detect anomalies, in particular when involved in User Behavior Analysis. This talk is a journey inside the cyber security techniques put in place at CloudLock to detect anomalies using Python. We will start our journey by looking at the data collection and processing implemented mostly inside celery tasks in order to produce a clean and enriched feed of billions of events daily. We will then present our use of Apache Spark MLLib with python and how we leverage AWS Lambda and EMR in our flexible infrastructure. Finally, we will show an example of data visualization around our threat map. We will also discuss the pros and cons of using Python with Apache Spark when dealing with scale as well as Docker as a way to encapsulate some parts of the data pipeline and to serve the models to the application.
